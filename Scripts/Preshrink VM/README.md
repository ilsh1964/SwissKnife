# preshrink-vm-virtualbox_linux_guest_shrink_preparation_tool

1. Description:

 Preshrink-VM is a tool that prepares Linux VirtualBox VM's to be shrunk with
 the vboxmanage modifyhd </path/to/thedisk.vdi> --compact command. All free
 space must be set to "zeros" for the command to work most efficiently.

2. Installation:

 Unzip the "preshrink-vm" bash script from the zip archive and move it to either
 /usr/local/bin or ~/bin. You can either do this from a command line or simply
 drag the file out of Archive Manager to wherever you'd like it to go.

 Note: scripts that are run from the ~/bin directory cannot be prefixed with
 'sudo' as the system will fail to find them. Those who intend to run
 PreShrink-VM from a script for cron, anacron or systemd timers should place it
 in /usr/local/bin This is also the best practice if there are more than one
 administrator accounts on the machine.

 before shrinking your VM.
