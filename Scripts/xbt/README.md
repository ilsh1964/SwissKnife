# xbt-external_backup_tool
XBT -- External Backup Tool (Version 2.3)

1. Description:

 XBT is a program that makes keeping all of your user data safely backed up on
 a dedicated External USB drive easy. XBT works with Ubuntu 16.04 onward and
 the Linux Mint 18.x series.

2. Installation:

 Unzip the 'XBT-2.3-installation-files' directory by dragging it out of the
 Archive Manager application onto your desktop and click on it see the files

 You can now install XBT from the provided xbt-install.sh script by clicking on
 the xbt-install.sh file inside a file manager. Choose "Run In Terminal" from
 the pop up menu. Alternately, you can choose Open In Terminal by right-clicking
 anywhere within the 'XBT-2.3-installation-files' directory. Run the
 xbt-install.sh script with this command:

  ./xbt-install.sh

 The installer will guide you from there.

 Note: The xbt-install.sh script MUST be run within 'XBT-2.3-installation-files'
 directory or it will exit with errors. It CANNOT be run directly from the zip
 archive. It is a good idea to log out and log back in before using XBT. The
 desktop needs to find the launcher and icon files.

3. Manual Installation:

 XBT can be run from a terminal simply by adding the script to either your ~/bin
 directory or /usr/local/bin. Open a terminal in 'XBT-2.3-installation-files'
 and use 'cp xbt ~/bin/' if you already have a personal bin directory. You can
 copy it to /usr/loca/bin with 'sudo cp xbt /userlocal/bin/'

 The program is immediately available for use by running the command 'xbt' in
 any terminal. XBT offers some direct terminal commands to jump to common
 functions. You can reead more about the in this file or in the only-line help
 page.

 Note: XBT won't work from a TTY or through SSH if the XBT Drive is not mounted
 at /media/user-name/XBT_Drive.

4. Un-installation

 The xbt-un-install.sh script will remove XBT if it was installed with the
 xbt.install.sh script explained above. It can be run from anywhere within
 the directory structure.

 Open the 'XBT-2.3-installation-files' directory and click on xbt-ub-install.sh
 file and choose Run in Terminal.  The script will guide you from there.

 You can also navaigate to the xbt-un-install.sh file from within a terminal and
 run it with this command:

  ./xbt.un-install.sh

 Errors reported in this script just mean it could not find all of the XBT
 files. This usually means XBT was not installed with xbt-install.sh and it
 will have to be removed manually.

 Note: XBT only consists of three files

    xbt = automatically installed in /usr/local/bin
    xbt.desktop = automatically installed in /user/share/application
    xbt-icon.xpm = automatically installed in /usr/share/icons

 You can use any file search utility to look for these fiels if you want to
 remove them. XBT does not create any configuration files on the system.
 One called xbt-backup.log and that is placed on the dedicated XBT Drive.

 Description:

 XBT is a program that makes keeping all of your user data safely backed up on
 a dedicated External USB drive.

 XBT will update files that have changed, remove files that have been
 deleted and add any new files that have been created since the last backup.
 The initial backup can take a lot of time if you have a lot of data stored
 in your system's /home directory. XBT creates a directory with the host name
 of the machine it's backing up from inside XBT-Backups. This allows users to
 share one XBT_Drive with multiple machines.

 The directory structure and all files are stored openly to allow users easy
 access if they only need to retrieve a few files or directories using a file
 manager. Data from /home can be restored with the built in "xbt restore"
 command if the user wants to roll back to the exact state of /home when the
 last backup was taken.

 A simple log file is added to the XBT_Drive that shows when each new
 backup is taken and any errors that might occur. This file is appended
 every time XBT is run. The log file is placed in XBT-Backups. You can view the
 last several backups by using the XBT Log viewer. Press "q" to exit when
 you're done.

 Requirements:

 XBT is designed to work with Ubuntu and Linux Mint but it should run
 on many other Linux distributions. You need to prepare an XBT Drive.
 This can be any USB storage device. The dedicated USB drive must be
 formatted to a Linux native file system such as Ext4 to ensure that file
 permissions will be stored unchanged. The USB drive needs to have enough
 free capacity to store all data in /home on all of the machines you want to
 use the drive for. The drive MUST be labeled as "XBT_Drive" for the script
 to run. If XBT_Drive is not detected, the script exits with an error.

 XBT Drive Setup allows you to choose a drive to designate as the XBT Drive. The
 selected drive will be "blanked," formatted with ext4 and labeled 'XBT_Drive."
 This option is available in the Main Menu.
