 Show displays text files in a terminal and formats to the terminal emulator
 display window but adds no other characters on the screen. Show is great for
 screencasts and presentations.

 Commands:

    show file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt (...more files) = display the contents
    of each file one at a time.

    show --help = shows this help page.

    You can give show as many files to work with as you like, just list one
    after another in the order you'd like to display them. Pressing any key
    will advance to the next file. The screen will be cleared but the user can
    scroll up to see the contents of the last file displayed. Pressing any key
    after the files have all been displayed will add a line to the bottom of
    the screen letting you know that there are no more files. Press any key
    once again to clear the screen and exit the program.

    Note: You must give show at least one file name to work with or it exits
    with an error.
